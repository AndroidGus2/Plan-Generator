<h3>What is a plan?</h3>
<p>Everyone knows what a plan is, a plan is an approach made to reach a desired outcome. This makes plans very easy to make because they are so simple but because they are so simple it is very easy to make a bad one.</p>
<h3>What makes a good plan?</h3>
<p>One of the main reasons for making a plan is to give you objectives that need to be completed in order for you to complete the objective of your plan 
  but a good plan identifies where issues can occur during your attempt to follow the plan and have ways of mitigating to outright dealling with issues 
  that can cause the failure of your plan. 
  This is what separates a good plan from a bad one, a good plan will allow anyone to complete the plans objectives but a bad one will require people who have enough experience to already know how to deal with upcoming issues who are also known as people who didn't need the plan in the first place.</p>
<h3>When to add depth to a plan?</h3>
<p>It depends on a case by case basis but a rule of thumb is it depends on how much time or money you will lose if you fail what you wree trying to do. This becomes very important in a business context because of the amount of money that goes into projects and stakeholders would want to know before hand if the project is even possible and what is the earliest signs to quit a project so they don't lose more money. </p>
